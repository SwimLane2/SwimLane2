## Hi, I’m Arjun 👋

I’m a **Solutions Architect** specialising in **API-led integration, digital commerce, payments, and supply chain–enabled systems**, with a strong focus on **Green IT and sustainable cloud-native architecture**.

I’m currently **pursuing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence**, applying AI and data concepts alongside hands-on architecture delivery to design efficient, resilient, and future-ready enterprise systems.

### Areas of focus
- Integration architecture (APIs, auth, orchestration, event-driven design)
- Digital commerce & payments (headless patterns, checkout, refunds)
- Supply chain & logistics systems (OMS/WMS/SAP integration)
- Sustainable and cost-efficient cloud design (Green IT principles)
- Applied AI and data-driven optimisation

### Principles I design by
- Clarity in decisions (IAs, ADRs, explicit trade-offs)
- Operability by default (monitoring, failure modes, supportability)
- Long-term value over short-term optimisation
